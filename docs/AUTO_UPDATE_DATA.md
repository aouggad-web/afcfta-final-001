# Automated Data Update System

This document describes the automated data update system for the AfCFTA project.

## Overview

The system automatically updates data from external sources on a daily schedule and can also be triggered manually. It fetches fresh data from:

- World Bank API (economic indicators)
- Country profiles and statistics
- JSON data files (ports, airports, production data)

## Components

### 1. Data Update Script (`backend/update_data_automated.py`)

A Python script that:
- Fetches latest data from World Bank API
- Updates country economic profiles
- Refreshes JSON data files with timestamps
- Generates detailed update reports

**Usage:**

```bash
# Run manually
python backend/update_data_automated.py
```

**Features:**
- Graceful error handling
- Detailed logging
- Update reports in JSON format
- Rate limiting to respect API limits

### 2. GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/auto_update_data.yml`)

An automated workflow that:
- Runs daily at 2:00 AM UTC
- Can be triggered manually from the Actions tab
- Commits and pushes data changes automatically
- Uploads update reports as artifacts

**Schedule:** Daily at 2:00 AM UTC (configurable via cron expression)

**Manual Trigger:**
1. Go to the repository's Actions tab
2. Select "Auto Update Data" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Choose the update type (all, worldbank, production, trade)
5. Click "Run workflow"

## Files Generated

The update process generates/updates the following files:

- `worldbank_data_latest.json` - Latest World Bank data for all African countries
- `data_update_report.json` - Detailed log of the update process (gitignored)
- `ports_africains.json` - Updated with timestamps
- `airports_africains.json` - Updated with timestamps
- `production_africaine.json` - Updated with timestamps

## Data Sources

### World Bank API

Fetches the following indicators for all 54 African countries:

- **GDP (NY.GDP.MKTP.CD)**: GDP in current US$
- **GDP per capita (NY.GDP.PCAP.CD)**: GDP per capita in current US$
- **Population (SP.POP.TOTL)**: Total population
- **GDP growth (NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG)**: Annual GDP growth rate

Data is fetched for years 2020-2024 (most recent 5 years).

## Workflow Details

### Automatic Execution

The workflow runs automatically every day at 2:00 AM UTC:

```yaml
schedule:
  - cron: '0 2 * * *'
```

### Manual Execution

You can manually trigger the workflow with different update types:

- **all**: Update all data sources (default)
- **worldbank**: Update only World Bank data
- **production**: Update only production data
- **trade**: Update only trade data

### Workflow Steps

1. **Checkout**: Checks out the repository
2. **Setup Python**: Installs Python 3.11 with pip caching
3. **Install Dependencies**: Installs required packages (requests, openpyxl, pandas)
4. **Run Update Script**: Executes the data update script
5. **Check Changes**: Detects if any data was modified
6. **Commit & Push**: Commits and pushes changes if any exist
7. **Generate Summary**: Creates a summary in the workflow output
8. **Upload Report**: Uploads the update report as an artifact (retained for 30 days)

## Error Handling

The system is designed to be resilient:

- **API Errors**: Network errors are logged but don't fail the workflow
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in delays between API calls
- **Graceful Degradation**: If external APIs fail, local updates still proceed
- **Detailed Logging**: All actions are logged for debugging

## Monitoring

### View Update Reports

Update reports are available in two ways:

1. **Workflow Summary**: Each workflow run generates a summary visible in the Actions tab
2. **Artifacts**: Detailed JSON reports are uploaded and retained for 30 days

### Check Update Status

```bash
# View the latest update report
cat data_update_report.json
```

The report includes:
- Timestamp
- Status (completed/failed)
- Number of updates performed
- Warnings and errors
- Detailed log of all operations

## Configuration

### Change Update Frequency

Edit the cron schedule in `.github/workflows/auto_update_data.yml`:

```yaml
schedule:
  - cron: '0 2 * * *'  # Daily at 2:00 AM UTC
```

Examples:
- `0 */6 * * *` - Every 6 hours
- `0 0 * * 1` - Weekly on Mondays
- `0 0 1 * *` - Monthly on the 1st

### Add New Data Sources

To add new data sources, edit `backend/update_data_automated.py`:

1. Add a new method to the `DataUpdater` class
2. Call the method in the `main()` function
3. Update the documentation

Example:

```python
def update_trade_data(self):
    """Update trade statistics"""
    self.log("Updating trade data...")
    # Your implementation here
```

## Integration with Existing Workflows

This workflow complements the existing `lyra_plus_ops.yml` workflow:

- **lyra_plus_ops.yml**: Updates AfCFTA-specific datasets (tariffs, rules of origin) weekly
- **auto_update_data.yml**: Updates general economic data (World Bank, country profiles) daily

Both workflows work independently and can run concurrently.

## Troubleshooting

### Workflow Not Running

- Check that GitHub Actions is enabled in repository settings
- Verify the cron schedule syntax
- Ensure the workflow file is in `.github/workflows/`

### API Errors

- World Bank API might be temporarily unavailable
- Check API status at https://data.worldbank.org/
- Review the update report for specific error messages

### No Data Changes

This is normal if:
- World Bank hasn't released new data
- The data is the same as the previous update
- The workflow will still run but not commit anything

### Permission Errors

Ensure the workflow has write permissions:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write
```

### Git Push Rejection (Non-Fast-Forward)

**Problem:** The workflow fails with error:
```
! [rejected]        main -> main (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs
```

**Cause:** The remote branch has changed since the workflow started (e.g., another workflow or manual push occurred).

**Solution:** The workflow now includes automatic conflict resolution:

1. **Pull and Rebase**: Before pushing, the workflow pulls the latest changes and rebases local commits on top
2. **Fallback to Merge**: If rebase fails (e.g., conflicts), it falls back to a merge strategy
3. **Retry Logic**: If push still fails, it retries up to 3 times with a 2-second delay between attempts

This ensures that the automated workflow can handle concurrent changes without manual intervention.

**Implementation details:**
```bash
# Pull and rebase before pushing
git pull --rebase origin main || {
  # If rebase fails, abort and try merge
  git rebase --abort 2>/dev/null || true
  git pull --no-rebase origin main
}

# Retry push up to 3 times
# (with pull between retries to handle new remote changes)
```

This same fix has been applied to both:
- `.github/workflows/auto_update_data.yml` (daily data updates)
- `.github/workflows/lyra_plus_ops.yml` (weekly Lyra+ dataset updates)

## Best Practices

1. **Monitor the first few runs** to ensure everything works as expected
2. **Review update reports** periodically to catch any issues
3. **Don't modify data files manually** - let the automation handle it
4. **Keep dependencies updated** in the workflow file
5. **Test changes locally** before pushing workflow modifications

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:

- [ ] Add email notifications on failure
- [ ] Integrate FAOSTAT for agricultural data
- [ ] Add UNCTAD for trade data
- [ ] Implement data validation checks
- [ ] Add Slack/Discord webhook notifications
- [ ] Create a dashboard for monitoring updates
- [x] Add retry logic for failed API calls (✅ Implemented for git push)
- [ ] Implement incremental updates (only changed data)
