<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user initially requested the completion of the logistics section of the application by adding a Terrestrial Logistics tab, providing a detailed data model and sources for road and rail corridors.

After the successful implementation of the entire logistics trilogy (Maritime, Air, and Land), the user introduced a new major feature request: to build a Production data module. This module should cover four key sectors for all African countries from 2021-2024:
1.  **Macro Value Added**: From World Bank (WDI) and IMF (WEO).
2.  **Agriculture**: Physical production data from FAOSTAT.
3.  **Manufacturing**: Detailed industrial data from UNIDO.
4.  **Mining**: Commodity production data from USGS.

The user approved an MVP approach starting with real data for 10 pilot countries.

**User's preferred language**: French. The next agent MUST respond in French.

**what currently exists?**
The application is a full-stack trade analysis tool with a React frontend and FastAPI backend. It features a trade calculator, country profiles, and a comprehensive Logistics tab. This tab is fully functional and divided into three sub-tabs:
1.  **Maritime**: Displays 68 ports on an interactive map and in a list view.
2.  **Air**: Displays 64 airports with detailed statistics, historical data, and actor/route information.
3.  **Terrestrial**: Displays 15 major PIDA road/rail corridors on a map using polylines, with details on nodes and status.

The backend scaffolding for the new Production feature has been initiated. A data file  with pilot data for 10 countries has been created, along with a new backend module  and the corresponding API endpoints in .

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working**: The agent was beginning the implementation of the new **Production Data feature**. It had just completed the backend scaffolding:
    1.  Created the data file  with pilot data for 10 countries across the 4 requested dimensions (macro, agriculture, manufacturing, mining) for the years 2021-2024.
    2.  Created the backend module  to handle this new data.
    3.  Added the necessary API endpoints () to .
    The next logical step is to build the frontend components to consume and display this data.
-   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done**: N (The new production endpoints have not been tested).
-   **Which testing method agent to use?**: backend testing agent (to test the new  endpoints).
-   **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no pending bugs or issues. The primary focus is on the new feature development.

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1: Complete Production Data Feature Implementation (P0)**
    -   **Where to resume**: The backend structure is in place. The next step is to build the frontend. This includes:
        1.  Creating a new main tab named **📈 Production** in .
        2.  Developing new React components to visualize the production data. This should include charts for time-series data (e.g., value-added % of GDP) and tables for detailed sectoral output (e.g., agricultural commodities, mining production).
        3.  Fetching data from the newly created backend endpoints ().
    -   **What will be achieved with this?**: A new, powerful feature for analyzing the productive capacity of African economies, directly addressing the user's latest request.
    -   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Both.
    -   **Blocked on something**: No.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Future Task 1: Full Data Population for Production Feature (P1)**
    -   The current implementation uses pilot data for 10 countries. A future task will be to execute the ETL strategy discussed with the user to populate the database with comprehensive data for all 55 African countries from the specified sources (World Bank, FAO, UNIDO, USGS).

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Air Logistics Feature (DONE)**:
    -   Fully implemented the Aérienne sub-tab with backend APIs and frontend components.
    -   Data was expanded to cover 64 airports in 53 countries.
    -   Fixed an issue where historical statistics were not displaying.
-   **Maritime Logistics Data Expansion (DONE)**:
    -   Increased the number of ports in the database from 52 to 68 for better coverage.
-   **Terrestrial Logistics Feature (DONE)**:
    -   Successfully implemented the Terrestre sub-tab, completing the logistics trilogy.
    -   Created backend APIs and frontend components to display 15 major PIDA corridors on a map using interactive polylines.
    -   Fixed a backend  related to the new module import in .

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   None. All issues raised by the user during this session were addressed.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   None observed in this session.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Full-stack Architecture**: React (frontend), FastAPI (backend).
-   **Data Storage**: JSON files acting as a database.
-   **UI/UX**: Tailwind CSS, Recharts for charts, Leaflet for interactive maps (including  for routes).
-   **API Design**: RESTful APIs with a  prefix, data loading modules separated from the main server file.
-   **Component-Based Frontend**: Reusable React components for cards, modals, and map views.

**key DB schema**
The application uses JSON files as data stores. The key structures are:
-   : 
-   : 
-   : 
-   : 

**changes in tech stack**
-   No changes to the core tech stack.

**All files of reference**
-   : Modified to add endpoints for Air, Land, and Production logistics.
-   : Heavily modified to restructure the Logistics tab into three sub-tabs and add components for each. It will need further modification for the Production tab.
-   , , : New modules to load data for their respective features.
-   : Contains all new frontend components for Air and Land logistics.
-   , , : New data files created to support the new features.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-    is growing very large and complex. It manages the state and rendering for all major features (Calculator, Statistics, Logistics, and soon Production). The content for each tab/sub-tab should be extracted into its own self-contained component file to improve maintainability and readability.

**key api endpoints**
-   **/api/logistics/air/airports**: Get all airports.
-   **/api/logistics/air/statistics**: Get aggregate air logistics stats.
-   **/api/logistics/land/corridors**: Get all terrestrial corridors.
-   **/api/logistics/land/statistics**: Get aggregate land logistics stats.
-   **/api/production/{dimension}**: Endpoints for each production dimension (e.g., , ).

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   The user is technically proficient and provides detailed, well-structured plans. Follow their specifications closely.
-   The development pattern is established: create data file (JSON), create backend module (), add endpoints to , create frontend components (), and integrate into .
-   The immediate task is to build the frontend for the **Production** feature. The backend scaffolding is already complete.
