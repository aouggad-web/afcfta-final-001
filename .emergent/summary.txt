<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user initiated a series of feature requests and data corrections to enhance a full-stack trade analysis application. The requests included:
1.  **World Bank Data Integration:** Update all 54 African country profiles with comprehensive data from the World Bank, including correcting Algeria's poverty rate to 0%.
2.  **Infrastructure Index Updates:** Integrate and repeatedly correct the Africa Infrastructure Development Index (AIDI) and the World Bank Logistics Performance Index (LPI) based on user-provided data and sources.
3.  **Structuring Projects Feature:** Add a new section to country profiles detailing major ongoing infrastructure and economic projects, starting with Algeria and later expanding to other nations.
4.  **Maritime Logistics Enhancement:** Overhaul the Logistics tab by adding highly detailed port information, including waiting times, performance evolution, shipping agent contacts, regular shipping lines, and World Customs Organization's Time Release Study (TRS) data.
5.  **Code Refactoring:** A major, agent-initiated refactoring of the main  file to improve maintainability.
6.  **Free Trade Zones Feature:** Add a new sub-tab within Logistics to display information about African free trade zones.

**User's preferred language**: French. The next agent MUST respond in French.

**what currently exists?**
The application is a feature-rich, full-stack platform (React/FastAPI) using local JSON/CSV files as its database. It now includes:
-   **Country Profiles:** Enriched with World Bank data, AIDI/LPI infrastructure rankings, and a new Structuring Projects section.
-   **Logistics Tab:** Significantly enhanced. It is now a multi-tabbed section containing:
    -   **Maritime Logistics:** Displays details for 68 ports, including granular data on wait times, TEU traffic evolution, shipping agent contacts, port authority websites, and modeled Time Release Study (TRS) metrics. A modal view provides in-depth info for each port.
    -   **Air and Land Logistics:** Existing sections.
    -   **Free Zones:** A newly added tab to display information on Africa's commercial free trade zones.
-   **Refactored Frontend:** The monolithic  has been successfully broken down into smaller, manageable components for each main tab (, , etc.), improving code structure.
-   **Backend:** Numerous new API endpoints and data loaders (, ) have been added to support the new features.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working**: Fulfilling the user's request to add the rest of the free zones to the newly created Free Zones feature. The agent updated the data source file  with more comprehensive data.
-   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done**: N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?**: Both.
    1.  **Backend:** Use  to call the  endpoint and verify that the response contains the complete list of free zones from the updated JSON file.
    2.  **Frontend:** Use the  on the Logistique -> Zones Franches tab to visually confirm that the UI correctly displays the full, expanded list of free trade zones.
-   **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1: Verify completion of the Free Trade Zones feature (P0)**
    -   The agent added more data to  at the user's request but did not test or verify the changes. The backend might not have reloaded the new data, and the frontend hasn't been checked.

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1: Complete and verify the Free Trade Zones feature (P0)**
    -   **Where to resume**: The  file has been updated. The next step is to test if the application correctly reflects this new, complete data.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?**: This will complete the user's latest feature request and ensure the Free Zones tab is fully functional and populated with all the required data.
    -   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Both.
    -   **Blocked on something**: No.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Future Tasks**:
    -   **Implement a real ETL pipeline for Production Data (P1)**: The current production data was generated by a one-off script. A future task is to build a proper ETL process to fetch and regularly update this data from official sources (World Bank WDI, FAOSTAT, UNIDO, USGS).
    -   **Replace Modeled TRS Data with Real Data (P2)**: The agent transparently informed the user that the Time Release Study (TRS) data is *estimated*. The user acknowledged this and mentioned they would work on it. A future task could be to provide a mechanism for the user to input official TRS data to replace the estimations.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **World Bank Data Integration (DONE)**: Script  was executed, and data for 54 countries was updated and verified.
-   **Infrastructure Indices (AIDI & LPI) (DONE)**: Integrated and performed multiple rounds of data correction for AIDI and LPI rankings based on intense user feedback.
-   **Structuring Projects Feature (DONE)**: Researched and added a new data section for major projects, first for Algeria and then expanded to 9 other countries.
-   **Maritime Logistics Overhaul (DONE)**:
    -   Enriched data for 68 ports with professional details (wait times, contacts, websites).
    -   Corrected Tanger Med port data specifically.
    -   Added modeled Time Release Study (TRS) data based on WCO framework.
    -   Fixed a bug where the port details modal was not displaying.
-   ** Refactoring (DONE)**: Successfully broke down the monolithic  into modular components (, , etc.).
-   **Free Trade Zones Feature (PARTIALLY DONE)**: Created the backend endpoint, data files, and frontend UI. The initial data set was populated.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   None. The agent was diligent in addressing user-reported data inaccuracies.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Full-stack Architecture**: React frontend, FastAPI backend.
-   **Data Storage**: Flat-file database using JSON and CSV files.
-   **Component-based Architecture**: The frontend was refactored from a monolithic  into a modular, component-based structure.
-   **Data Sourcing & Scripting**: Heavy reliance on Python scripts for data generation, correction, and enrichment.
-   **User-Driven Data Correction**: A recurring workflow where the user provides precise data corrections, which are then implemented via scripts.

**key DB schema**
-   : 
-   : 
-   : Each port entry was enriched with , , , and .

**changes in tech stack**
-   No changes to the core technology stack.

**All files of reference**
-   : The refactored entry point for all logistics tabs.
-   : The new UI component for the last feature.
-   : The data file for the last feature, which was just updated.
-   : Contains the new API endpoints.
-   : The new backend data loader for free zones.
-   : The main frontend file, now refactored to be a shell.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The  file has already been refactored, which was the most critical need.
-   Future consideration could be given to consolidating the numerous data update scripts into a more organized data management or ETL module.

**key api endpoints**
-   : Returns profile data including infrastructure and projects.
-   : **New**. Fetches structuring projects for a country.
-   : Returns data for all 68 enriched ports.
-   : Returns details for a single port.
-   : **New**. Fetches all free trade zone data.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **DATA ACCURACY IS PARAMOUNT**: The user is extremely detail-oriented and will manually verify data. Any new data must be sourced carefully. Be prepared for correction requests.
-   **Transparency on Data Sources**: The agent previously admitted that the Time Release Study (TRS) data was *modeled* rather than sourced directly. The user appreciated this honesty. Maintain this level of transparency. If data is an estimation, state it clearly.
-   **The frontend has been refactored**: Do not look for UI logic for tabs inside . Navigate to the specific component files under  (e.g., , ).

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Working**: The application is fully functional. The refactoring has improved frontend architecture.
-   **Broken**: Nothing is broken, but the latest change (completing free zone data) is unverified.
-   **Mocked**: The Time Release Study (TRS) data is explicitly modeled/estimated, a fact the user is aware of.

**3rd Party Integrations**
-   None involving API keys. Data is sourced via scraping public websites (World Bank, etc.) or from user-provided information, then stored in local files.

**Testing status**
-   **Testing agent used after significant changes**: YES, a screenshot was successfully taken after the major  refactoring.
-   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop**: NO.
-   **Test files created**: None.
-   **Known regressions**: None.

**Credentials to test flow:**
-   N/A

**What agent forgot to execute**
-   The agent forgot to test its last action. After overwriting  with more complete data, it did not restart the backend (if needed) or run any  or  tests to verify that the new data is being served by the API and rendered correctly on the frontend.</analysis>
